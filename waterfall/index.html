      Waterfalls are natural wonders where water cascades over a vertical drop
      or cliff. They are formed by various geological processes, including
      erosion and the flow of rivers. One famous example is Niagara Falls,
      located on the border between the United States and Canada. Waterfalls are
      not only breathtakingly beautiful but also play a crucial role in shaping
      landscapes. The force of falling water creates a mesmerizing spectacle,
      attracting tourists and providing habitats for unique flora and fauna.
      Additionally, waterfalls often hold cultural significance in many
      societies and are popular destinations for adventure seekers and nature
      enthusiasts.
