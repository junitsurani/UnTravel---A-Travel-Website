            A jungle is a dense and lush ecosystem typically found in tropical
            regions, characterized by a high diversity of plant and animal
            species. It consists of thick vegetation, including tall trees,
            vines, and various plant species, creating a complex and
            interconnected habitat. Jungles play a crucial role in maintaining
            global biodiversity and are often referred to as rainforests when
            located in regions with consistent rainfall. These ecosystems are
            home to a wide array of wildlife, from insects and amphibians to
            mammals and birds, making them vital for the overall health of the
